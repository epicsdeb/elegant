This element simulates a time-dependent kicker magnet as a rectangular
dipole with no fringe field effects.  To use this element, you must
supply an SDDS file giving the time-dependent waveform.  The element
is called {\tt BUMPER} to because {\tt HKICK}, {\tt VKICK}, {\tt
KICKER} are used for steering magnets.

The arrival time of the beam is taken to define the reference time,
$t=0$.  Hence, if the waveform file has the maximum amplitude at
$t=0$, the beam will get kicked at the peak of the waveform.  If the waveform
peaks at $t=t_{peak}$, then setting \verb|TIME_OFFSET| equal to $-t_{peak}$
will ensure that the beam is kicked at the peak amplitude.

By default, the kicker fires on the first beam passage.  However, if 
\verb|FIRE_ON_PASS| is used, then the kicker is treated like a drift space until
the specified pass.

If \verb|PHASE_REFERENCE| is non-zero, then the initial timing is
taken from the first time-dependent element that has the same
\verb|PHASE_REFERENCE| value.  This would allow, for example,
simulating several kickers firing at the same time.  Delays relative
to this reference time can then be given with positive adjustments to
\verb|TIME_OFFSET|.

The input file need not have equispaced points in time.  However, the
time values should increase monotonically.

This element simulates a dipole kicker only.  For multipole kickers, see the
{\tt MBUMPER} element.
