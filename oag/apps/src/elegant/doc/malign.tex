The default value of the \verb|PASS| parameter (-1) means that the misalignment is
imposed on the beam {\em every} pass.  This is appropriate for static misalignments.
When using the \verb|MALIGN| element to kick the beam for beam dynamics studies in rings, \verb|PASS>=0| is
required.  If \verb|PASS=0|, closed orbit computation and correction will include the effect of
the kick; however, matrix-based computations by default will not (set \verb|FORCE_MODIFY_MATRIX=1| to
change this).  If \verb|PASS>0|, then closed orbit computation and correction do not include
the kick, which is probably what is desired in beam dynamics studies in rings.
