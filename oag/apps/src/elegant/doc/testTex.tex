This element is based on section 3.3.1 of the {\em Handbook of
Accelerator Physics and Engineering}, specifically, the
subsections {\bf Single Coulomb scattering of spin-${\rm \frac{1}{2}}$
particles}, {\bf Multiple Coulomb scattering through small angles},
and {\bf Radiation length}.
There are two aspects to this element: scattering and energy loss.

{\bf Scattering.}  The multiple Coulomb scattering formula is used
whenever the thickness of the material is greater than $0.001 X_o$,
where $X_o$ is the radiation length.  (Note that this is inaccurate
for materials thicker than $100 X_o$.)  For this regime, the user need
only specify the material thickness (L) and the radiation length (XO).

For materials thinner than $0.001 X_o$, the user must specify
additional parameters, namely, the atomic number (Z), atomic mass (A),
and mass density (RHO) of the material.  Note that the density is
given in units of $kG/m^3$.  (Multiply by $10^3$ to convert $g/cm^3$
to $kG/m^3$.)  In addition, the simulation parameter PLIMIT may be
modified.  

To understand this parameter, one must understand how {\tt elegant}
simulates the thin materials.  First, it computes the expected number
of scattering events per particle, $ E = \sigma_T n L = \frac{K_1
\pi^3 n L}{K_2^2 + K_2*\pi^2} $, where $n$ is the number density of
the material, L is the thickness of the material, $K_1 = (\frac{2 Z
r_e}{\beta^2 \gamma})^2$, and $K_2 = \frac{\alpha^2
Z^\frac{2}{3}}{\beta\gamma}$, with $r_e$ the classical electron radius
and $\alpha$ the fine structure constant.  The material is then broken
into $N$ slices, where $N = E/P_{limit}$.  For each slice, each
simulation particle has a probability $E/N$ of scattering.  If scattering
occurs, the location within the slice is computed using a uniform
distribution over the slice thickness.

For each scatter that occurs, the scattering angle, $\theta$ is
computed using the cumulative probability distribution
$F(\theta>\theta_o) = \frac{K_2 (\pi^2 - \theta_o^2)}{\pi^2 (K_2 +
\theta_o^2)}$.  This can be solved for $\theta_o$, giving
$\theta_o = \frac{(1-F)K_2\pi^2}{K_2 + F \pi^2}$.  For each scatter,
$F$ is chosen from a uniform random distribution on $[0,1]$.

{\bf Energy loss.}  Energy loss simulation is very simple.
The energy loss per unit distance traveled, $x$, is 
${\frac dE}{dx} = -E/X_o$.  Hence, in traveling through a
material of thickness $L$, the energy of each particle is
transformed from $E$ to $E e^{-L/X_o}$.
