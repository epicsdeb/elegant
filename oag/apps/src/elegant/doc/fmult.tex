This element simulates a multipole element using a 4th-order sympletic
integration.  
Specification of the multipole strength is through an SDDS file.
The file is expected to contain a single page of
data with the following elements:
\end{raggedright}
\begin{enumerate}
\item An integer column named {\tt order} giving the order of the multipole.
The order is defined as $(N_{poles}-2)/2$, so a quadrupole has order 1, a
sextupole has order 2, and so on.
\item A floating point column named {\tt KnL} giving the integrated strength of
the multipole, $K_n L$, where $n$ is the order.  The units are $1/m^n$.
\item A floating point column named {\tt JnL} giving the integrated strength of
the skew multipole, $J_n L$, where $n$ is the order.  The units are $1/m^n$.
\end{enumerate}

The {\tt MULT} element is also available, which allows the same
functionality without an external file.
