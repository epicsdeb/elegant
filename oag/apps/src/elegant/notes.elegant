Fixed problem with trajectory output from orbit correction.  Was 
outputing the wrong final trajectory/orbit when y correction
aborted before x correction.

Added ability to compute and output the fixed-path-length response
matrix.  Also added the ability to use this matrix, or the ordinary
one, for orbit correction.  These changes affect the horizontal
plane only.
