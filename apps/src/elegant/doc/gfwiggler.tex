N.B.: at present this element is {\em not} included in computations
of beam moments (\verb|moments_output| command).

This element simulates a wiggler or undulator using the generate
function method given by J. Bahrdt and G. W\"{u}stefeld (``Symplectic
tracking and compensation of dynamic field integrals in complex
undulator structures,'' PRSTAB 14, 040703, 2011.). 

To use the element, one must supply an SDDS file giving harmonic
analysis of the wiggler field. The field expansion used by the code is
for a wiggler working at the nominal gap and provide pure horizontal
deflecting to the on-axis beam. See \verb|CWIGGLER|, horizontal
wiggler with normal poles, for detail explaination of the field
expansion and format of the input file. Besides the required columns
of {\tt Cmn}, {\tt KxOverKw}, {\tt KyOverKw}, and {\tt KzOverKw} by
the \verb|CWIGGLER| elements, two more input columns are needed:
\begin{itemize}
\item The longitudinal harmonic number, $n$, in column {\tt zHarm}.
\item The horizontal harmonic number of $l$, in column {\tt xHarm}.
\end{itemize}
If a file include all required columns from \verb|CWIGGLER| and
\verb|GFWIGGLER| then user can use either of the both methods for
simulating a horizontal planar wiggler.

An universal wiggler field, which be used for generating an arbitrary
polarization, can be derived by given different longitudinal phase
parameters: {\tt PHASE\_1,2,3,4}. The photon energy can be varied by a
non-zero {\tt D\_GAP} value.
