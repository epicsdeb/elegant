This element simulates a quadrupole using a matrix of first, second,
or third order.

By default, the element has hard edges and constant field within the
defined length, {\tt L}.  However, soft-edge effects (up to second
order) may be added using the {\tt FFRINGE} and {\tt FRINGE\_TYPE}
parameters.  If {\tt FFRINGE} is zero (the default), then the magnet
is hard-edged.  If {\tt FFRINGE} is positive, then the magnet has
linear fringe fields of length {\tt FFRINGE*L/2} at each end.  That
is, the total length of fringe field from both ends combined is {\tt
FFRINGE*L}.

Depending on the value of {\tt FRINGE\_TYPE}, the fringe fields are
modeled as contained within the length {\tt L} (``inset'' type) or
extending symmetrically outside the length {\tt L} (``fixed-strength''
type).

For ``inset'' type fringe fields, the length of the ``hard core'' part of
the quadrupole is {\tt L*(1-FFRINGE)}.  For ``fixed-strength'' type fringe fields,
the length of the hard core is {\tt L*(1-FFRINGE/2)}.  In the latter case,
the fringe gradient reaches 50\% of the hard core value at the nominal boundaries
of the magnet. This means that the integrated strength of the magnet does not
change as the {\tt FFRINGE} parameter is varied. This is not the case with
``inset'' type fringe fields.
