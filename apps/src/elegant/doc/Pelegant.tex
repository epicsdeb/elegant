\section{Introduction}

{\tt Pelegant} stands for ``parallel elegant'', which is a parallelized
version of {\tt elegant}~\cite{elegant}.  Written in the C programming
language with MPICH, the {\tt Pelegant} has been successfully ported to
several clusters and supercomputers, such as the ``weed'' cluster at APS, 
the Fusion cluster at Argonne National Lab, and the BlueGene supercomputer
 at  Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. Thanks to
careful design in parallelization and good architecture of the serial
{\tt elegant}, the {\tt Pelegant} achieves very good performance. For example, for a
simulation of $100,000$ particles in APS including symplectic
element-by-element tracking, accelerating cavities, and crab cavities,
the simulation time was reduced from 14.3 days to 42 minutes on 512
CPUs of the BlueGene/L (BG/L) supercomputer. The speedup for this
particular simulation is 484 with efficiency near 95\%.

This document describes how to build {\tt Pelegant}, run the code and
optimize the performance. An explicit list of elements which have NOT  been parallelized can be found in the appendices. The user can also check if an element has been parallelized
from the latest {\tt elegant} manual. 
The list of commands which  have been used in the regression tests is available at the end of the appendices.  
The user should be familiar with the \htmladdnormallink{User's Manual for {\tt elegant}}{http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Operations_Analysis/manuals/elegant_latest/elegant.html}  before reading this document.


\section{{\tt Pelegant} installation}

The binaries of {\tt Pelegant} for different platforms have been distributed together with the {\tt elegant} executables.
The detail information about the prebuilt {\tt Pelegant} can be found at \\
     \htmladdnormallink{Prebuilt Pelegant usage for multi-core computers}{http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Operations_Analysis/installationGuide_Pelegant.shtml}.
\\\\
For some users, it might be useful to build Pelegant from the source code. We provide the steps in building {\tt Pelegant} on Linux as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Install MPICH (1 or 2). This step can be done by either the user or the cluster administrator. Add the location of MPI executables in your PATH.
\item If you are using an x86 processor, set the environment variables HOST\_ARCH and EPICS\_HOST\_ARCH to linux-x86 (or linux-x86\_64 for 64 bits). If you are using a ppc processor you can set these variables to linux-ppc.
\item If EPICS/Base is already installed on your computer you can skip to the next step. {\tt Pelegant} is built using the EPICS/Base configure files available from the OAG web site at APS. You will need to unpack this to create epics/base/configure. Go to the epics/base directory and type make.
\item Next you will need to download the EPICS extensions configure files from the OAG web site. This will unpack to create epics/extensions/configure. Go to the epics/extensions/configure directory and type make.
\item Download the latest SDDS source code from the OAG web site. This will unpack to create epics/extensions/src/SDDS. Go to this directory and type make.
\item Go to the epics/extensions/src/SDDS/SDDSlib directory and run the following commands to build parallel SDDS library:
\begin{verbatim}
make clean
make MPI=1
\end{verbatim}
\item Go to the epics/extensions/src/SDDS/pgapack directory to build the parallel genetic algorithm library:
\begin{verbatim}
make
\end{verbatim}
\item Download the OAG configure files from the OAG web site. This will unpack to create oag/apps/configure. Go to this directory and type make.
\item Download the {\tt Pelegant} source code from the OAG web site. This will unpack to create oag/apps/src/elegant. 
\item Set the path for your installation of MPICH in Makefile.OAG in oag/apps/src/elegant. This is not required if the MPI executables are in your PATH.
\item From oag/apps/src/elegant, run the following command to build {\tt Pelegant}:
\begin{verbatim}
 make Pelegant
\end{verbatim}
{\tt Pelegant} should now exist at oag/apps/bin/linux-x86/Pelegant.  (To build the serial version, just 
type ``make.''  This will also build related software.)

{\tt elegant} and {\tt Pelegant} share the same source code.
Makefile will decide which part of code will be compiled according to the binary file 
(either {\tt Pelegant} or {\tt elegant}) you want to build.
\end{enumerate}
  
{\noindent}If you have any question about installing the {\tt Pelegant}, please send an email to soliday@aps.anl.gov

\section{Running a simulation with {\tt Pelegant}}

Running a parallel job is just as easy as starting a serial job, while
the time spent on a job can be reduced from several days to hours, or
even minutes.  {\tt Pelegant} has been tested under both MPICH-1 and
MPICH-2. We suggest to use MPICH-2 if possible, as it shows better
stability in our regression test. In the future, we may also add new
features available in MPI-2, such as remote memory
operations, to improve the performance of {\tt Pelegant} for some
simulations.

\subsection{Running {\tt Pelegant} with MPI command}

An examples directory is available under the elegant directory in the source code. User can run a simulation with given
lattice and input files according to the version of the MPI implementation.

 For example, we can choose the Pelegant\_ringTracking1 example to run the parallel 
{\tt elegant} on 11 processors (10 working processors) with the following commands:
\footnote {For the weed cluster in APS,  all the MPI related commands 
have been put in the options of csub command. User could just type: 

    csub -mvapich2 11 Pelegant manyParticles\_p.ele 
 }

1) For MPI-1, we can use the following syntax:

\indent\indent mpirun -np 11 Pelegant manyParticles\_p.ele

2) For MPI-2, mpiexec is strongly encouraged to start MPI programs, e.g.:

\indent\indent mpiexec -np 11 Pelegant manyParticles\_p.ele


One can run another simulation with the serial version of {\tt elegant} for comparison at the same time:

\indent\indent elegant manyParticles\_s.ele
  
The contents of the input files are same, while ``\_p'' and ``\_s'' are corresponding
to the input file of {\tt Pelegant} and {\tt elegant} respectively. 
User should check the {\tt elegant} manual to prepare the input file. 
 
 
In principle, user can run simulations on any number of processors. We have
tested the program with more than 30,000 cores on the Intrepid (Bluegene/p) supercomputer  at Argonne National Lab.
While the number of processors can not be more than the number of particles to track for most of simulations, as it will not use the resource efficiently. For certain simulations, such as parallel optimizations, the number of CPUs is limited to the number of scenarios to be simulated for a parameter set.

 
 
\subsection {Validating the result} 
 
The simulations  above were finished in around 1 minute for {\tt Pelegant} and 10 
minutes for {\tt elegant} on the AMD Athlon nodes of the weed cluster in APS. 
To convince ourselves the results of the two 
versions of {\tt elegant} are same, one can compare the output files with the 
sddsdiff command, which should be available  in the SDDS toolkit.
 For example, to examine the particle coordinates at interior points, we can type: 
 
sddsdiff manyParticles\_p.w2 manyParticles\_s.w2 
 
\noindent which should return that two results are identical. 
 
Validating a parallel program against a uniprocessor program with the 
requirement of bitwise identical result is notoriously difficult~\cite{Gropp05}, as we 
may meet some new problems raised from parallel computing, such as different 
ordering of summations, non-scalable random number generator. Although the 
simulation results with the discrepancies should conform to IEEE 754 within 
some tolerance, more consistent results can be expected with more accurate 
numerical algorithm, such as Kahan's summation formula~\cite{Goldberg91}, which has been 
employed in both serial and parallel versions of {\tt elegant}. 
 
We ran a regression test of 92 cases and validated the results of {\tt Pelegant} 
with {\tt elegant}. As the random number sequences generated by one CPU 
and multiple CPUs usually are not same, some test examples can't be validated 
by comparing the results of {\tt elegant} and {\tt Pelegant}. Those examples 
have been validated either by mathematical formulae or their physical meaning. 


\section{Using {\tt Pelegant} efficiently}

As the {\tt elegant} parallelization is an on-going project, we first parallelized
the tracking elements through partitioning the particles to multiple CPUs. We have
parallelized 95 out of 102 elements for tracking simulations. The elements
which have not been parallelized are listed at the end of
this manual. As most time-intensive elements have been
parallelized, we can expect a good speedup and efficiency for this type of simulations.
 If a simulation is slow due to a particular element, the user is encouraged to send the input files to us for a performance study. After the tracking elements have been parallelized, I/O becomes the bottleneck of the simulation, especially for simulations requiring a very large number of particles. We developed parallel SDDS library~\cite{PSDDSlib} to meet the I/O requirement for large-scale computation. The parallelization of frequency map analysis, dynamic aperture search, and position-dependent momentum aperture determination is discussed in~\cite{Wang09}.  Recently, we also added several parallel optimization options to {\tt Pelegant}, including Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA), Hybrid Parallel Simplex (HPS) and Parallel Particle Swarm Optimization (PPSO). The usage of these parallel optimization methods can be found in the \verb|parallel_optimization_setup| section of \htmladdnormallink{User's Manual for {\tt elegant}}{http://www.aps.anl.gov/Accelerator_Systems_Division/Operations_Analysis/manuals/elegant_latest/elegant.html}.

\subsection{Parallelization overview}

To help users run simulations with {\tt Pelegant} more efficiently, we
would like to introduce our parallelization approach for the tracking elements briefly.  We
parallelize {\tt elegant} using a master/slaves (manager/workers)
model. The time-intensive tracking parts of {\tt elegant} are being
parallelized gradually. The other parts are done (redundantly) by all
the processors, which is acceptable since those processors have
already been allocated to a particularly {\tt Pelegant} run. We divide
the beamline elements to four classes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Parallel element: only the slave processors will do the tracking. 
Each slave is responsible for a portion of particles.

\item MP (multiprocessor) algorithm: the master will participate in
the tracking, but it only gets the result of collective computations
(e.g. sum, average) from the slaves, without doing any computations itself.

\item Uniprocessor element: must be done by master (for now) and modifies
particle coordinates.
\item Diagnostic: could run on master or slaves, but doesn't change particle coordinates.
\end{enumerate}

A flag was added to {\tt elegant}'s dictionary for each beamline
element to identify its classification. The master is responsible for
gathering and scattering particles as needed according to this
classification. Communications are minimized to achieve the best
efficiency of parallelization. For example, it is not necessary to
communicate the coordinates of particles between master and slaves
when tracking through two continuous parallel elements.

\subsection {Achieving high performance}
As {\tt Pelegant} uses parallel SDDS library for parallel I/O operations, it is suggested to use a parallel file
system to achieve best performance. {\tt Pelegant} has been tested on several parallel file systems, such as GPFS, 
PVFS, Lustre, etc.. The NFS file system is compatible with parallel I/O if configured properly, but the
speed for I/O operations is not scalable.

In our master/slave model, the master is responsible for tracking in the Uniprocessor 
elements. To run simulations efficiently, we also suggest when possible that the user arrange all serial 
elements in a continuous sequence, which will minimize the communication 
overhead for gathering and scattering particles. This become less necessary for the latest Pelegant, as 
most elements have been parallelized. 

For ANL users (or others who have an ALCF account), we can provide help to perform runs on the Fusion 
cluster (2,560 Intel CPU-cores, each with a 2.67 GHz Xeon) or Intrepid supercomputer (163,840 cores, PowerPC 450, 850 MHz) at ANL.  {\tt Pelegant} is pre-built and available on both systems. 

\section{What is not supported}

In our regression test for {\tt Pelegant}, we excluded certain types of tests, which are not supported
in this version of {\tt Pelegant}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item All of the tests tracking beam with one particle (or the number of particles is less than 
the number of processors) were excluded, as such a simulation will not benefit from the 
parallelization approach we employed. 


\item The second type of tests we excluded are those needing slice analysis. 
They are not supported in {\tt Pelegant} at present.

\end{enumerate}

It is suggested to run a
simulation with a small workload first before trying the final
time-intensive simulation.  Also, use of WATCH elements with {\tt
FLUSH\_INTERVAL=1} can be helpful in verifying that progress is being
made.  We listed the commands have been tested in appendices. Users can
report bugs with all the input files to ywang25@aps.anl.gov or
borland@aps.anl.gov.

\section{Appendices}

\subsection{Elements that have been parallelized in {\tt Pelegant}}

The particular physical elements that take advantage of parallel computation in the present version of the code are:
\begin{enumerate}

\item Drift spaces, dipoles, quadrupoles, sextuoples, higher
multipoles, dipole correctors, and wiggler magnets, whether
symplectically integrated or modeled with a transport matrix (up to
3rd order).  Symplectically integrated elements can optionally include
both quantum and classical synchrotron radiation effects.

\item Radio frequency cavities, including accelerating and deflecting cavities, with constant field amplitude.

\item Accelerating cavities with phase, voltage, and frequency modulation or ramping.

\item Beam collimating and scraping elements.

\item Field-map integration elements, such as dipoles, x-y dependent maps, and solenoids.

\item Reference energy matching points.

\item Beam watch points, which may involve parallel computation of beam moments or dumping of particle coordinates.

\item Scattering elements, including lumped-element simulation of synchrotron radiation.\\
\end{enumerate}


\noindent 
We have a very small number of elements which have not been parallelized. They are either new elements or used infrequently. Here is an explicit list of the elements which have NOT been parallelized:

\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Commands that have been tested for {\tt Pelegant}}
In addition to tracking, the following features of {\tt elegant} may be used in the parallel version:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Optimization with tracking.  In this case, user can choose the optimization to be supervised at the serial level or parallel level, while the tracking is done in parallel.
\item Computation and output of Twiss parameters and transport matrices along a beamline.
\item Computation and output of beam statistics along a beamline.
\item Alteration of element properties, loading of element parameters from external files, and transmutation of element types.
\item Scanning of element properties in loops.  In this case, the scanning is supervised at the serial level while the tracking is done in parallel.
\item Use of internally-generated or externally-supplied particle distributions.
\item Addition of random errors to accelerator components.
\item Computation and output of closed orbits.
\end{enumerate}
