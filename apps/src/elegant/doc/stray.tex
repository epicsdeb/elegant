This element simulates stray fields.  These fields are considered
perturbations, in that they change the trajectory (or orbit), but not
the floor coordinates.  Local stray fields ({\tt LBX} and {\tt LBY})
are referenced to the local coordinate system.  Global stray fields
({\tt GBX}, {\tt GBY}, {\tt GBZ}) are referenced to the global
coordinate system, which coincides with the local coordinate system
only at the start of the beamline (unless there is no bending, in
which case the two systems are identical).
