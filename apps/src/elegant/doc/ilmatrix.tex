This element allows fast, symplectic tracking of transport through a
periodic cell with chromatic and amplitude-dependent tunes, beta
functions, and dispersion.  This is done by computing a linear matrix
for every particle.  The linear matrix is composed from Twiss
parameters, tunes, dispersion, etc., supplied by the user.  The user
can also supply selected chromatic and amplitude derivatives of these
quantities, which are used to compute the individual particle's beta
functions, tune, dispersion, etc., which in turn allows computing the
individual particle's linear matrix.

Using this element is very similar to using linear chromatic matrix
tracking via the \verb|setup_linear_chromatic_tracking| command.
The advantage is that using {\tt LMATRIX}, one can split a ring into segments
and place, for example, impedance elements between the segments.

This element was inspired by requests from Y. Chae (APS).

N.B.: There is a bug related to using {\tt ILMATRIX} that will result in a crash
if one does not request computation of the twiss parameters. If you encounter this
problem, just add the following statement after the \verb|run_setup| command:
\begin{verbatim}
&twiss_output
        matched = 1
&end
\end{verbatim}
