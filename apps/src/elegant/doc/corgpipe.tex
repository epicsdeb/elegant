This element implements the longitudinal wake for a corrugated pipe
using a model by K. Bane \cite{Bane-SLAC14925}.
The method used is identical to that for the \verb|WAKE| element.
The only difference is that instead of providing a file to specify the
wake, one specifies the parameters of Bane's model, as described above.

Setting the {\tt N\_BINS} and {\tt TMAX} paramaters to 0 is recommended.  This results
in auto-scaling of the number of bins and the time spacing of the wake to ensure
sufficient length to cover the beam and a sufficiently fine time step to resolve
the oscillations in the wake.

As with \verb|WAKE|, the default degree of smoothing ({\tt SG\_HALFWIDTH=4}) may be excessive.
It is suggested that users vary this parameter to verify that results
are reliable if smoothing is employed ({\tt SMOOTHING=1}).
