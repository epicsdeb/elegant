Description: ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking package
 Elegant stands for "ELEctron Generation ANd Tracking", a somewhat 
 out-of-date description of a fully 6D accelerator program that 
 now does much more than generate particle distributions and track
 them. elegant, written entirely in the C programming language, 
 uses a variant of the MAD input format to describe accelerators, 
 which may be either transport lines, circular machines, or a 
 combination thereof. Program execution is driven by commands in a 
 namelist format.
